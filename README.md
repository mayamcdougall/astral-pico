# Astral Theme for Pico
Port of HTML5 UP's [Astral][] theme for [PicoCMS][].

> First of its kind on H5U! Astral features a flat, minimalistic design, a fully animated interface (with noscript fallbacks), and styling for all basic page elements (including blockquotes, tables and lists). Enjoy!

## Getting Started

To use this theme:

1. Download the [Latest Release][] on GitHub.
2. Extract `themes/astral` to your Pico `themes` folder.
3. Extract `sample-content/index.md` to your `content` folder.
4. Set your `theme` to `astral` in Pico's `config.yml`.
5. Configure your website using the YAML options in `index.md`

Other sample files, `contact.md` and `gallery.md`, are provided for your reference.  You may use them if you wish, or simply create your own.

Adding the `Gallery` variable to your YAML will create an image gallery at the bottom of your page.  Each item in `Gallery` needs a `url` and `image` variable.

Adding the `Contact` variable to your YAML will create a contact form at the bottom of your page.  The contents of the `Contact` variable will become the `action` attribute of your contact form.
